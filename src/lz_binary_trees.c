	 * Here's my explanation of how this code actually works.  Beware: this
	 * algorithm is a *lot* trickier than searching for matches via hash
	 * chains.  But it can be significantly better, especially when doing
	 * "optimal" parsing, which is why it gets used, e.g. in LZMA as well as
	 * here.
	 *
	 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	 *
	 *				Data structure
	 *
	 * Basically, there is not just one binary tree, but rather one binary
	 * tree per hash code.  For a given hash code, the binary tree indexes
	 * previous positions in the window that have that same hash code.  The
	 * key for each node is the "string", or byte sequence, beginning at the
	 * corresponding position in the window.
	 *
	 * Each tree maintains the invariant that if node C is a child of node
	 * P, then the window position represented by node C is smaller than
	 * ("left of") the window position represented by node P.  Equivalently,
	 * while descending into a tree, the match distances ("offsets") from
	 * the current position are non-decreasing --- actually strictly
	 * increasing, because each node represents a unique position.
	 *
	 * In addition, not all previous positions sharing the same hash code
	 * will necessarily be represented in each binary tree; see the
	 * "Updating" section.
	 *
	 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	 *
	 *				  Searching
	 *
	 * Suppose we want to search for LZ77-style matches with the string
	 * beginning at the current window position and extending for @max_len
	 * bytes.  To do this, we can search for this string in the binary tree
	 * for this string's hash code.  Each node visited during the search is
	 * a potential match.  This method will find the matches efficiently
	 * because they will converge on the current string, due to the nature
	 * of the binary search.
	 *
	 * Naively, when visiting a node that represents a match of length N, we
	 * must compare N + 1 bytes in order to determine the length of that
	 * match and the lexicographic ordering of that match relative to the
	 * current string (which determines whether we need to step left or
	 * right into the next level of the tree, as per the standard binary
	 * tree search algorithm).  However, as an optimization, we need not
	 * explicitly examine the full length of the match at each node.  To see
	 * that this is true, suppose that we examine a node during the search,
	 * and we find that the corresponding match is less (alt. greater) than
	 * the current string.  Then, because of how binary tree search
	 * operates, the match must be lexicographically greater (alt. lesser)
	 * than any ancestor node that corresponded to a match lexicographically
	 * lesser (alt. greater) than the current string.  Therefore, the match
	 * must be at least as long as the match for any such ancestor node.
	 * Therefore, the lengths of lexicographically-lesser (alt. greater)
	 * matches must be non-decreasing as they are encountered by the tree
	 * search.
	 *
	 * Using this observation, we can maintain two variables, 'best_lt_len'
	 * and 'best_gt_len', that represent the length of the longest
	 * lexicographically lesser and greater, respectively, match that has
	 * been examined so far.   Then, when examining a new match, we need
	 * only start comparing at the index min(best_lt_len, best_gt_len) byte.
	 * Note that we cannot know beforehand whether the match will be
	 * lexicographically lesser or greater, hence the need for taking the
	 * minimum of these two lengths.
	 *
	 * As noted earlier, as we descend into the tree, the potential matches
	 * will have strictly increasing offsets.  To make things faster for
	 * higher-level parsing / match-choosing code, we do not want to return
	 * a shorter match that has a larger offset than a longer match.  This
	 * is because a longer match can always be truncated to a shorter match
	 * if needed, and smaller offsets usually (depending on the compression
	 * format) take fewer bits to encode than larger offsets.
	 * Consequently, we keep a potential match only if it is longer than the
	 * previous longest match that has been found.  This has the added
	 * advantage of producing the array of matches sorted by strictly
	 * increasing lengths as well as strictly decreasing offsets.
	 *
	 * In degenerate cases, the binary tree might become severely
	 * unbalanced.  To prevent excessive running times, we stop immediately
	 * (and return any matches that happen to have been found so far) if the
	 * current depth exceeds @max_search_depth.  Note that this cutoff can
	 * occur before the longest match has been found, which is usually bad
	 * for the compression ratio.
	 *
	 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	 *
	 *				Updating
	 *
	 * I've explained how to find matches by searching the binary tree of
	 * the current hash code.  But how do we get the binary tree in the
	 * first place?  Since the tree is built incrementally, the real
	 * question is how do we update the tree to "add" the current window
	 * position.
	 *
	 * The tree maintains the invariant that a node's parent always has a
	 * larger position (a.k.a. smaller match offset) than itself.
	 * Therefore, the root node must always have the largest position; and
	 * since the current position is larger than any previous position, the
	 * current position must become the root of the tree.
	 *
	 * A correct, but silly, approach is to simply add the previous root as
	 * a child of the new root, using either the left or right child pointer
	 * depending on the lexicographic ordering of the strings.  This works,
	 * but it really just produces a linked list, so it's not sufficient.
	 *
	 * Instead, we can initially mark the new root's left child pointer as
	 * "pending (less than)" and its right child pointer as "pending
	 * (greater than)".  Then, during the search, when we examine a match
	 * that is lexicographically less than the current string, we link the
	 * "pending (less than)" pointer to the node of that match, then set the
	 * right child pointer of *that* node as "pending (less than)".
	 * Similarly, when we examine a match that is lexicographically greater
	 * than the current string, we link the "pending (greater than)" pointer
	 * to the node of that match, then set the left child pointer of *that*
	 * node as "pending (greater than)".
	 *
	 * If the search terminates before the current string is found (up to a
	 * precision of @nice_len bytes), then we set "pending (less than)" and
	 * "pending (greater than)" to point to nothing.  Alternatively, if the
	 * search terminates due to finding the current string (up to a
	 * precision of @nice_len bytes), then we set "pending (less than)" and
	 * "pending (greater than)" to point to the appropriate children of that
	 * match.
	 *
	 * Why does this work?  Well, we can think of it this way: the "pending
	 * (less than)" pointer is reserved for the next match we find that is
	 * lexicographically *less than* the current string, and the "pending
	 * (greater than)" pointer is reserved for the next match we find that
	 * is lexicographically *greater than* the current string.  This
	 * explains why when we find a match that is lexicographically less than
	 * the current string, we set the "pending (less than)" pointer to point
	 * to that match.  And the reason we change "pending (less than)" to the
	 * right pointer of the match in that case is because we're walking down
	 * into that subtree, and the next match lexicographically *less than*
	 * the current string is guaranteed to be lexicographically *greater
	 * than* that match, so it should be set as the right subtree of that
	 * match.  But the next match in that subtree that is lexicographically
	 * *greater than* the current string will need to be moved to the
	 * "pending (greater than)" pointer farther up the tree.
	 *
	 * It's complicated, but it should make sense if you think about it.
	 * The algorithm basically just moves subtrees into the correct
	 * locations as it walks down the tree for the search.  But also, if the
	 * algorithm actually finds a match of length @nice_len with the current
	 * string, it no longer needs that match node and can discard it.  The
	 * algorithm also will discard nodes if the search terminates due to the
	 * depth limit.  For these reasons, the binary tree might not, in fact,
	 * contain all valid positions.
