/*
 * Build the LCP (Longest Common Prefix) array in linear time.
 *
 * LCP[r] will be the length of the longest common prefix between the suffixes
 * with positions SA[r - 1] and  SA[r].  LCP[0] will be undefined.
 *
 * Algorithm taken from Kasai et al. (2001), but modified slightly:
 *
 *  - For decreased memory usage and improved memory locality, pack the two
 *    logically distinct SA and LCP arrays into a single array SA_and_LCP.
 *
 *  - With bytes there is no realistic way to reserve a unique symbol for
 *    end-of-buffer, so use explicit checks for end-of-buffer.
 *
 *  - If a LCP value is less than the minimum match length, then store 0.  This
 *    avoids having to do comparisons against the minimum match length later.
 *
 *  - If a LCP value is greater than the "nice match length", then store the
 *    "nice match length".  This caps the number of bits needed to store each
 *    LCP value, and this caps the depth of the LCP-interval tree, without
 *    usually hurting the compression ratio too much.

/*
 * Use the suffix array accompanied with the longest-common-prefix array --- in
 * other words, the "enhanced suffix array" --- to simulate a bottom-up
 * traversal of the corresponding suffix tree, or equivalently the "lcp-interval
 * tree", as described in Abouelhoda et al. (2004).
 *
 * While doing the traversal, create a table 'intervals' that contains data for
 * each lcp-interval, specifically the lcp value of that interval, and the index
 * of the superinterval.
 *
 * Also while doing the traversal, create a table 'pos_data' that contains a
 * mapping from suffix index to the deepest lcp-interval containing it.
 *
 * The result is that we will later be able to do match-finding at a given
 * position by looking up that position in 'pos_data' to get the deepest
 * lcp-interval containing the corresponding suffix, then proceeding to the
 * superintervals.  See lcpit_advance_one_byte() for more details.
 *
 * Note: We limit the depth of the lcp-interval tree by capping the lcp at
 * LCP_MAX.  This can cause a sub-tree of intervals with lcp greater than
 * LCP_MAX to be collapsed into a single interval with lcp LCP_MAX.  This avoids
 * degenerate cases and does not hurt match-finding very much, since if we find
 * a match of length LCP_MAX and extend it as far as possible, that's usually
 * good enough because that region of the input must already be highly
 * compressible.
