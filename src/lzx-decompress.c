/*
 * LZX is an LZ77 and Huffman-code based compression format that has many
 * similarities to the DEFLATE format used in zlib.  The compression ratio is as
 * good or better than DEFLATE.
 *
 * Some notes on the LZX compression format as used in Windows Imaging (WIM)
 * files:
 *
 * A compressed WIM resource consists of a table of chunk offsets followed by
 * the compressed chunks themselves.  All compressed chunks except possibly the
 * last decompress to a fixed number of bytes, by default 32768.  This is quite
 * similar to the cabinet (.cab) file format, but they are not the same.
 * According to the cabinet format documentation, the LZX block size is
 * independent from the CFDATA blocks, and an LZX block may span several CFDATA
 * blocks.  However, in WIMs, LZX blocks do not appear to ever span multiple WIM
 * chunks.  Note that this means any WIM chunk may be decompressed or compressed
 * independently from any other chunk, which allows random access.
 *
 * An LZX compressed WIM chunk contains one or more LZX blocks of the aligned,
 * verbatim, or uncompressed block types.  For aligned and verbatim blocks, the
 * size of the block in uncompressed bytes is specified by a bit following the 3
 * bits that specify the block type, possibly followed by an additional 16 bits.
 * '1' means to use the default block size (equal to 32768, the default size of
 * a WIM chunk), while '0' means that the block size is provided by the next 16
 * bits.
 *
 * The cabinet format, as documented, allows for the possibility that a
 * compressed CFDATA chunk is up to 6144 bytes larger than the data it
 * uncompresses to.  However, in the WIM format it appears that every chunk that
 * would be 32768 bytes or more when compressed is actually stored fully
 * uncompressed.
 *
 * The 'e8' preprocessing step that changes x86 call instructions to use
 * absolute offsets instead of relative offsets relies on a filesize parameter.
 * There is no such parameter for this in the WIM files (even though the size of
 * the file resource could be used for this purpose), and instead a magic file
 * size of 12000000 is used.  The 'e8' preprocessing is always done, and there
 * is no bit to indicate whether it is done or not.
 */

/*
 * Some more notes about errors in Microsoft's LZX documentation:
 *
 * Microsoft's LZX document and their implementation of the com.ms.util.cab Java
 * package do not concur.
 *
 * In the LZX document, there is a table showing the correlation between window
 * size and the number of position slots. It states that the 1MB window = 40
 * slots and the 2MB window = 42 slots. In the implementation, 1MB = 42 slots,
 * 2MB = 50 slots. The actual calculation is 'find the first slot whose position
 * base is equal to or more than the required window size'. This would explain
 * why other tables in the document refer to 50 slots rather than 42.
 *
 * The constant NUM_PRIMARY_LENS used in the decompression pseudocode is not
 * defined in the specification.
 *
 * The LZX document states that aligned offset blocks have their aligned offset
 * Huffman tree AFTER the main and length trees. The implementation suggests
 * that the aligned offset tree is BEFORE the main and length trees.
 *
 * The LZX document decoding algorithm states that, in an aligned offset block,
 * if an extra_bits value is 1, 2 or 3, then that number of bits should be read
 * and the result added to the match offset. This is correct for 1 and 2, but
 * not 3, where just a Huffman symbol (using the aligned tree) should be read.
 *
 * Regarding the E8 preprocessing, the LZX document states 'No translation may
 * be performed on the last 6 bytes of the input block'. This is correct.
 * However, the pseudocode provided checks for the *E8 leader* up to the last 6
 * bytes. If the leader appears between -10 and -7 bytes from the end, this
 * would cause the next four bytes to be modified, at least one of which would
 * be in the last 6 bytes, which is not allowed according to the spec.
 *
 * The specification states that the Huffman trees must always contain at least
 * one element. However, many CAB files contain blocks where the length tree is
 * completely empty (because there are no matches), and this is expected to
 * succeed.
